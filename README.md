# VIBFold

This repository contains code for running AlphaFold on the Ghent University HPC systems in a streamlined and more user-friendly way. More details can be found on  the VIB course page on AlphaFold, found at https://elearning.bits.vib.be/courses/alphafold/.

This codebase was largely inspired and based on ColabFold (https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold).
